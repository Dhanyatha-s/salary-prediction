Linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical technique in machine learning and statistics. 
It's used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the target or response variable) and one or more independent variables
(also called features or predictors). The simplest form is simple linear regression, where there is only one independent variable, and the relationship 
is modeled as a straight line.
